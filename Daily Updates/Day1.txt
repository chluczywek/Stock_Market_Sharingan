Challenges and Considerations
While neural networks offer significant advantages, they come with challenges. It’s essential to carefully tune the model’s parameters and hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, etc.).
Additionally, stock market data can be noisy and prone to overfitting — where the model learns patterns in the training data too well but fails to generalize for unseen data.
Other challenges include:
Data Quality: Stock data is often noisy. Preprocessing becomes crucial to remove outliers and irrelevant features.
Computational Resources: Neural networks, especially deep ones, require significant computational power. Training large models can be time-consuming and costly.
